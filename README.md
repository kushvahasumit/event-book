## Project Insights
### 3 Things I Learned
1. **Grid Formation of the Calendar** - Implementing a structured and dynamic event grid according to the dates of the calendar.
2. **Integration of New Libraries** - Learning how to integrate and use external libraries like dnd-kit & date-fns efficiently.
3. **Event Management with Drag & Drop** - Handling event movement within the calendar.

### Most Difficult Part
- **Grid formation** and aligning events properly.
- **Event management** with drag-and-drop functionality.

### What I Would Do Differently With More Time
- **Improve UI/UX** for better interactivity.
- **Edge cases** by optimizing code and adding edge cases for smooth functionality.
- **Enhance Performance** by optimizing state management (useEffect).
- **Implement Additional Features**, such as edit event title and time.
